<div>Hello Professor<span class="profName"></span>,

Iâ€™m a student representative of deltaHacks, the first Canadian Hackathon for Change run by a student club in McMaster. This Hackathon is a 24-hour event where university programmers and entrepreneurs collaboratively bring their amazing ideas to life. Though using software and hardware we hope to make a positive impact on the environment, health and wellness or inequality and education . The event will take place from Feb 14th to 15th.

I am wondering if you would be interested in volunteering at our hackathon in one of the following roles:

 - Idea Generation Group:
Help students determine a field of focus of their projects.

 - Talk/Workshop:
Introduce your work further with demonstrations and in-depth explanation.
You do not have to be present, you can do it through video talks.

 - Mentor:
Guide students on their projects throughout the hackathon.

 - Judge:
Determine which project(s) has the best impact in your field of study.

If there is anyone you think would be interested (like your PhD students), can you please forward this email to them?

I appreciate your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. I am looking forward to discussing more about the event with you in person.

Regards,
