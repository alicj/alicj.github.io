<div>Dear Professor<span class="profName"></span>,

I’m a student representative of deltaHacks, the first Canadian Hackathon for Change run by a student club in McMaster. This Hackathon is a 24-hour event where university programmers and entrepreneurs collaboratively bring their amazing ideas to life. Though using software and hardware we hope to make a positive impact on the environment, health and wellness or inequality and education . The event will take place from Feb 14th to 15th.

I am wondering if you would be interested in volunteering at our hackathon in one of the following roles:

 - Idea Generation Group:
Help students determine a field of focus of their projects.

 - Talk/Workshop:
Introduce your work further with demonstrations and in-depth explanation.
You do not have to be present, you can do it through video talks.

 - Mentor:
Guide students on their projects throughout the hackathon.

 - Judge:
Determine which project(s) has the best impact in your field of study.

If there is anyone you think would be interested (like your PhD students), can you please forward this email to them?

I appreciate your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. I am looking forward to discussing more about the event with you in person.

Regards,

						Dear Professor <span class="profName"></span>,
						<br><br>
						Thank you very much for being interested in volunteering in our event.<br>
						The schedule can be found at http://deltahacks.io/
						<br><br>
						The Idea Generation Group happens on Saturday from 11:00AM - 12:00PM for an hour. It is a chance for anyone who has an idea that can be achieved using technology, yet do not have the technical skill to do it. They will have 1-5 minutes to pitch about their idea to attract programmers.
						<br><br>
						Talk/Workshop will be an extended version of Idea Generation, where you have 15-60 minutes to talk about a problem you are passionate about. Talks should take place mostly from Saturday afternoon til night, so people can get familiar with the problem and then start work on them.
						<br><br>
						Mentors do not have to be here all the time, but we advise them to work with the students until they are clear of the problem they are working on. They also do not need to be tecnical. When groups of students are interested in and work on a problem you talked about, since they may have very limited knowledge about the problem, you can guide them throughout the hackathon and make sure they are on the right track of solving the problem.
						<br><br>
						Judging will take place on 12-4PM on February 15th, 2015.
