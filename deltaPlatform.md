#BETTER, STRONGER, SUPERIOR#

Hello, my name is Alic. I was a past Relations member (2014), Head of Logistics (2015), and Sponsor Representative (2016) for DeltaHacks. As a Relation member, I contacted over 100 McMaster professors from different departments to enrich hack ideas for attendees. As Head of Logistics, I learnt how to oversee projects in a macro-perspective which will assist me to direct the DeltaHacks team better. As a sponsor representative, I experienced DeltaHacks in a different point of view and will be able to provide unique feedback to improve DeltaHacks experience for sponsors.

This year’s DeltaHacks team did a fantastic job on the overall planning and executing! The ceremonies, the food, the post clean-up - every part of the hackathon is a big step up from last year! And I want to make next year a year to remember. For next year, I aim for [better team management](#better-team-management), [stronger external communication](#stronger-external-communication), and [superior overall experience](#superior-overall-experience). Also, please do checkout the [Q&A section](#qa).

Better Team Management
--
#####Transparent and Uniform Communication Channel
I will create a transparent and uniform communication channel for teams. I want to have bi-weekly general meetings between leader of each team with the co-directors to update status with each other. Then, each leader will update their team with the general status which ensures all members are up-to-date. This will ensure that teams are working tightly and cooperatively and eliminate communication barriers. The teams will work more efficiently if they are aware of the big picture. For example, a more informed team can avoid sending duplicate emails.

#####Team Bonding Events
I also seek to improve bonds between team members. I propose that we have monthly social events. For example, we could get together and enjoy movie nights, rock climbing, bowling, etc.. This will help team members to get to know each other better, resulting in a more harmonious team atmosphere.

#####Help Members Grow
To help team members grow, team leaders should have a short monthly one-on-one meeting with each team members. In a 10-15 minutes meeting, leaders will ask the members on their general feeling towards the team and any positive/negative feedback. This will help leaders to improve their way of managing. It will also give a channel for members to voice themselves.

Stronger External Communication
--
#####Timely Communication
We need to update them with important information in a timely manner. Chris, the head of sponsor team from Indellient, received the email asking about his interest of being a judge two days prior to the hackathon. This created an unprofessional image for DH team, as such email would have served better if it was send at least a week earlier. I will work with the Head of Relations to set hard deadlines on each type of email sent to our sponsors and mentors, to make sure that they have enough time to arrange for our request.

#####Professional Image
On top of that, I will also create emailing protocols with the Head of Relations, to ensure we communicate in a professional and consistent manner. Such as methods to ensure  For example, I received two emails for mentor sign-up this year, from different people with different forms. It was quite confusing and rendered an unprofessional image for DH team. Later, I found out that it was because people from different teams were confused about their responsibility and thus contacted some people twice. Having emailing protocols outlining things such as how to mark contacts in different status will avoid contacting them twice.


Superior Overall Experience

#####More Mentors and Judges
I want to increase the amount of mentors and judges. With a hack-for-change theme, we need to have at least 10-15 professional mentors and judges from different industries (health care, environment, government, infrastructure, etc.). In order to accomplish this, we need to start contacting them early, preferably in summer or at the latest, September.

#####More Balanced Budget
I seek to create a more balanced budget. For example, we had brilliantly designed stickers this year, but they ran out quickly; we also had excessive leftovers after each meal. We need to find ways to balance out the spending on each item, so that we don’t overspend or underspend.

#####Female Oriented Advertising
We had an impressive female ratio this year. I want to continue motivating female attendees. For instance, we could have some female targeted advertising throughout the year. We could post “Female Computer Scientist of the week” on our Facebook page, have female oriented posters, and even work with Thode library to showcase more female their storyboard. We could also look for more female mentors.

#Q&A

Strength and Weakness
--
I am able to see the big picture while maintaining abilities to complete specific task. My past experience as Head of Logistics really trained my ability to oversee projects in a macro-perspective. I improved the logistic planning process from 2014 significantly. I categorized the tasks, arranged them by priorities, and assigned them to the appropriate people. I also drafted several budgets to suit different financial needs. I handled the timeline well that there was no last minute rush on big decisions such as food, bus, or venue booking.

I can also handle stress and pressure well. I can quickly analyse urgent situations, make rational decisions, and execute accordingly in a timely manner. For example, in 2014, I was given the job to purchase 40 power bars on the week of the hackathon. We needed them within 5 days on a very limited budget. I found an affordable source and completed the purchase within 24 hours.

On the contrary, I can be too focused on specificity and minute detail regarding tasks. However, my past experience of being Head of Logistics has taught me to step back and to see the bigger picture regularly.Moreover, this disadvantage becomes advantageous in some situations. For instance, when there aren’t enough people, I can easily jump in and complete some task quickly and efficiently. 


Commitment

I am able to make 1-2 hours per day on average for DH, and up to 15-20 hours per week if necessary.

I was a past Relations member (2014), Head of Logistics (2015), and Sponsor Representative (2016) for DeltaHacks. As a Relation member, I contacted over 100 McMaster professors from different faculties to enrich hacking ideas for attendees. I worked with one other teammate and I divided up the professors by department to ensure that we do not contact the same professor twice. I also made an email templating tool (alicj.github.io/deltaProf.html) to make writing emails more efficient. As a result, we were able to contact all McMaster professors in a month, met multiple professors, and successfully invited some to Idea Generation session on very short notice. I was able to break down a given task into smaller problems and build appropriate tools to execute them effectively. I also learnt to quickly analyse urgent situations, make rational decisions, and execute accordingly in a timely manner. For example, I was given the job to purchase 40 power bars on the week of the hackathon. We needed them within 5 days on a very limited budget. I found an affordable source and completed the purchase within 24 hours. 

As Head of Logistics, I learnt how to oversee projects in a macro-perspective. I improved the logistics planning over the previous year. In 2014, the Logistics team disappeared and people from Relations had to pitch in at the last minute. In 2015, I categorized the tasks, arranged them by priorities, and assigned them to the appropriate people. I also drafted several budgets to suit different financial needs. Though I became too focused on details of larger tasks, that I overlooked some smaller ones, I was able to quickly shift my focus and include them in the agenda. When there were not enough people to complete the jobs, I jumped in and got my hands dirty. For example, when the team is focused on food, bus, and venue booking, I took on smaller purchasing jobs such as wrist bands, lunch bags, etc. and completed them promptly.

As a sponsor representative, I experienced DeltaHacks in a very different point of view. I can provide unique feedback to improve DeltaHacks experience for sponsors. For example, I received two emails for mentor sign-up this year, from different people with different forms. It was quite confusing and rendered an unprofessional image for DH team. Later, I found out that it was because people from different teams were confused about their responsibility and thus contacted some people twice. As outlined in my platform, this can be solved by having regular general meeting to make all teams more informed. Moreover, being a sponsor rep this year, I am able to experience what sponsors expect from the event and what it likes to interact with attendees. As a sponsor, we want to gain more exposure from students and associate our name with an approachable brand. We want students to be interested in what we do, and ask us more in-depth questions. As a smaller company, the most frequent question we answered was “What do you do?”. I think it would be more beneficial for both the sponsors and attendees to include a brief introduction of sponsor companies, so that the attendees can gain some insight beforehand and ask more thoughtful questions during the event. The attendees will have a more memorable interaction with the sponsors. 

I have also been working in teams in the real world in the past year. I learnt plenty from my managers about team management and project planning. As described in my platform, I will bring in the one-on-one reviews and social events to create a more harmonious atmosphere. The regular general meetings will help to create a more transparent and uniform communication channel.
