#BETTER, STRONGER, SUPERIOR#

Hello, my name is Alic. I was a past Relations member (2014), Head of Logistics (2015), and Sponsor Representative (2016) for DeltaHacks. As a Relation member, I contacted over 100 McMaster professors from different departments to enrich hack ideas for attendees. As Head of Logistics, I learnt how to oversee projects in a macro-perspective which will assist me to direct the DeltaHacks team better. As a sponsor representative, I experienced DeltaHacks in a different point of view and will be able to provide unique feedback to improve DeltaHacks experience for sponsors.

This year’s DeltaHacks team did a fantastic job on the overall planning and executing! The ceremonies, the food, the post clean-up - every part of the hackathon is a big step up from last year! And I want to make next year a year to remember. For next year, I aim for [better team management](#better-team-management), [stronger external communication](#stronger-external-communication), and [superior overall experience](#superior-overall-experience).

Better Team Management
--
I will create a transparent and uniform communication channel for teams. I want to have bi-weekly general meetings between leader of each team with the co-directors to update status with each other. Then, each leader will update their team with the general status which ensures all members are up-to-date. This will ensure that teams are working tightly and cooperatively and eliminate communication barriers. The teams will work more efficiently if they are aware of the big picture. For example, a more informed team can avoid sending duplicate emails.

I also seek to improve bonds between team members. I propose that we have monthly social events. For example, we could get together and enjoy movie nights, rock climbing, bowling, etc.. This will help team members to get to know each other better, resulting in a more harmonious team atmosphere.

To help team members grow, team leaders should have a short monthly one-on-one meeting with each team members. In a 10-15 minutes meeting, leaders will ask the members on their general feeling towards the team and any positive/negative feedback. This will help leaders to improve their way of managing. It will also give a channel for members to voice themselves.

Stronger External Communication
--
I want to create a uniform and timely communication with sponsors and mentors. We need to update them with important information in a timely manner. We need also make sure that we communicate consistent information with them.


Superior Overall Experience
--
I want to increase the amount of mentors and judges. With a hack-for-change theme, we need to have at least 10-15 professional mentors and judges from different industries (health care, environment, government, infrastructure, etc.). In order to accomplish this, we need to start contacting them early, preferably in summer or at the latest, September.

I seek to create a more balanced budget. For example, we had brilliantly designed stickers this year, but they ran out quickly; we also had excessive leftovers after each meal. We need to find ways to balance out the spending on each item, so that we don’t overspend or underspend.

We had an impressive female ratio this year. I want to continue motivating female attendees. For instance, we could have some female targeted advertising throughout the year. We could post “Female Computer Scientist of the week” on our Facebook page, have female oriented posters, and even work with Thode library to showcase more female their storyboard. We could also look for more female mentors.

In conclusion, I strive to create better team management, stronger external communication, and superior overall experience for next year.
