simpleTabs
==========
A simple FireFox addon where user can choose a fixed number of tabs/quick links to be displayed on a new tab.

With responsive design, the annoying feature where there are more tabs on a high resolution screen and less on a lower one is gone. Perfect choice for people use external monitor(s) like I do.
