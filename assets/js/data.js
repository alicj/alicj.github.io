		title: "Coffee Bot",
		note: "Indellient",
		icon: "fas fa-coffee",
		content: `What happens when software developers with thirst for coffee are too busy coding to 
		check the coffee pot status? We started this project at Indellient to have a Slack bot tell us whether 
		coffee is brewing, how many cups of coffee are there left, and whether new coffee needs to be made. 
		I worked on the Slack bot integration part of the project. I found the right ruby library to use 
		for Slack bot integration, and did a lot of research to figure out how to let Slack Bot DM Slack users 
		on its own - it is actually a pretty hard thing to do!

		(a templating library), I was able to build a small app that pulls data from specified

		title: "CentraCare",
		note: "DementiaHacks 2015, Toronto",
		icon: "far fa-heart",
		content: `Working with another programmer and three other health science students,
		 	we built a prototype for a platform for caregivers to have better understanding of 
		 	the patients with dementia. During the building of the project, I learnt and 
		 	implemented AngularJS, which is super fun despite the struggling. <br/> Due to 
		 	the nature of the disease, the patients tend to avoid social interaction, which is 
		 	actually necessary for them and would help them stay healthier. So we built this 
		 	platform for the families of patients to fill out for the caregivers to read prior 
		 	to their arrival to help build a connection between them and the patient, that they 
		 	would understand what actions to take under certain circumstances, and have meaningful 
		 	conversations and realationships with the patients.`,		date: "Nov 7-8, 2015",
