		<p>Hello there!</p>
		<p>My name is Zichen Jiang. I also go by the name Alic. I major in <code>Computer Science</code> in McMaster University, and am expected to graduate in 2018.</p>

		<p>I have a rich background in web development. In my most recent internship at <a href="https://www.indellient.com/zichen-jiang-tales-internship-indellient/" title="Indellient">Indellient</a>, I integrated <code>Google Drive</code>, <code>SharePoint</code>, and <code>SAML</code> authentication into an existing web application. I also adapted the application for different devices, and improved memory usage by 10%. Besides web development, I also gained hands on experience in <code>Data Warehousing</code> with <code>OLAP</code> systems. On top of the that, I also connected the database to visualization tools and created dashboards to help clients make smarter decisions.</p>
<!-- or should i say i focus on growing in all dimensions -->
		<p>I am also passionate about using technologies for good. I was the director of <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3991768/students-hack-for-change-during-24-hour-marathon-event-at-mcmaster/" title="DeltaHacks IV">DeltaHacks IV</a>, in which we encourage students to create projects with real social impact by providing them with challenges faced by local communities and organizations. I have gained vaulable experiences in teamwork, team building, problem solving,  effective communication, and project management from my involvement.</p>
