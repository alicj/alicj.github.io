		<p>Hello there!</p>
		<p>My name is Zichen Jiang. I also go by the name Alic. I major in <code>Computer Science</code> in McMaster University located in Hamilton, ON Canada.</p>

		<p>I love everything about <code>technology</code>. Though I do love hardware <span class="text-muted">(staring at a motherboard is just so peaceful and extrodinary)</span>, I mainly focus on software, especially <code>Web Development</code>.</p>

		<p>I am actively involved in a student group called <a href="http://hackitmac.com/" title="">HackitMac</a> in McMaster University. It is a club for students who are interested in learning, building, and experiencing with different cool technologies. I am majorly involved in planning <a href="http://deltahacks.com/">DeltaHacks</a>, an annual hackathon at McMaster University. We were even featured in <a href="http://www.chch.com/hackathon/">CHCH Morning Live</a>!</p>
