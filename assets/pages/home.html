		<p>Hello there!</p>
		<p>My name is Zichen Jiang. I major in <code>&ltComputer Science&gt</code> in McMaster University located in Hamilton, ON Canada.</p>

		<p>I love everything about <code>&lttechnology&gt</code>. Though I do love hardware <span class="text-muted">(staring at a motherboard is just so peaceful and extrodinary)</span>, I mainly focus on software, especially <code>&ltWeb Development&gt</code>.</p>

		<p>I also love food, more specificly, Chinese food. By the way I'm from China. I cook Chinese food myself and I quite enjoy my cooking. I love chocolate too. I even drink chocolate milk, given that I dislike milk.</p>

		<p>I loving drawing too, and took class outside school for over 8 years. I like still life sketching and cartoon/anime drawing. Also I draw in the traditional way, with a pencil on paper, not sketchpad on computer.</p>

		<p>I also like music. I prefer classical music. I play a bit guitar myself but I prefer listening to music, rather than playing it.</p>
